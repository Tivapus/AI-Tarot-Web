## üöÄ Getting Started

You can get a local copy up and running by following these simple steps. This project is fully containerized with Docker for easy setup.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Tivapus/AI-Tarot-Web.git](https://github.com/Tivapus/AI-Tarot-Web.git)
    cd AI-Tarot-Web
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    There are two services that need environment variables. Create a `.env` file in each directory.

    - **Backend (`ai-tarot-backend/`)**
      Create a file named `.env` inside the `ai-tarot-backend` directory:

      ```bash
      touch ai-tarot-backend/.env
      ```

      Add your Gemini API key to this file:

      ```env
      # ai-tarot-backend/.env
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
      ```

    - **Frontend (`ai-tarot-frontend/`)**
      Create a file named `.env.local` inside the `ai-tarot-frontend` directory:
      ```bash
      touch ai-tarot-frontend/.env.local
      ```
      Add the backend API URL. When running with Docker Compose, the service name `ai-tarot-backend` acts as the hostname.
      ```env
      # ai-tarot-frontend/.env.local
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
      ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    From the root directory of the project, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend and start the services.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    - Frontend (Next.js): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - Backend (Go): [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

1.  Navigate to the homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2.  Select the type of reading you want (e.g., 1-card or 3-card spread).
3.  Enter the question you want to ask the cards.
4.  Click the "Shuffle" button to shuffle the deck.
5.  Select the required number of cards from the fanned deck.
6.  Once you've made your selections, you will be taken to the results page to see the AI-generated interpretation of your reading.

## üîå API Endpoints

The Go backend exposes the following REST API endpoint:

- **`POST /api/interpret`**
  - Receives a user's question and the names of the selected cards, and returns an AI-generated interpretation from the Gemini API.
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "question": "What should I focus on in my career?",
      "cards": ["The Magician", "The Sun", "Temperance"]
    }
    ```
  - **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "interpretation": "The combination of The Magician, The Sun, and Temperance suggests..."
    }
    ```
